# CNN-Training_an_MLP_on_MNIST
Convolutional Neural Network -Training an MLP on MNIST
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. A MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.

## About the project : 
Let's begin by investigating how deep learning can be used to recognize handwritten numerical digits.
We'll design in image classification algorithm that takes pictures of handwritten numbers and identifies the numbers represented in the images.
To do this, we'll use the MNIST Database which Each depicts one of the numbers zero through nine.
his database is perhaps one of the most famous databases in the field of machine learning.
After importing the necessary python module,it's only one line of code to get our train and test images along with their corresponding labels.
When we look at the first six training images,we immediately notice that some digits are more legible than others.
It will need to attain some level of understanding for what makes a hand-drawn one look like a one,and how images of ones differ from images of twos or threes.
